* The Tree State

	Git has three main states that your files can reside in:
	committed, modified, and staged.

	Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

	Modified means that you have changed the file but you have not
	committed it to your database yet.

	Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current
	version to go into your next commit snapshot.

	This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the Git
	directory, the Working directory, and the Staging area.

	Each file in working directory can be in one of two states:
	tracked and untracked.

	Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot. They can be
	unmodified, modified, or staged.

	Untracked files are everything else any files in your working directory
	that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.
