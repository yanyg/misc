rfc 3720 iSCSI
SCSI is a client-server architecture.
Clients of a SCSI interface are called "initiators".
Initiators issue SCSI "commands" to request services from components,
logical units of a server known as "target".
A "SCSI transport" maps the client-server scsi protocol to a specific
interconnect. An initiator is one endpoint of a SCSI transport and  a
target is the other endpoint.

The SCSI protocol has been mapped over various transports, including
Parallel SCSI, IPI, IEEE-1394 (firewire) and Fibre Channel. These
transports are I/O specific and have limited distance capabilities.

The iSCSI protocol defined in this document describe a means of
transporting SCSI packet over TCP/IP, providing for an interoperable
solution which can take advantage of existing Internet infrastructure,
Internet facilities, and address distance limitations.
