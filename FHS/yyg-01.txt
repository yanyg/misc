* /bin
	* useful commands for both administrator and non-privileged users
		like as cp, mv, cat, rm, etc.

	* these commands must be available even if only the partition / is
	  mounted.

	* boot scripts may depend on these commands.

* /boot
	stores data that is used before the kernel begins executing user-mode
	programs.

	This may include redundant (backup) MBR, sector/system map files, the
	kernel and other important boot files and data that is not directly
	edited by hand.

	Programs necessary to arrange for the boot loader to be able to boot a
	file are placed in /sbin.

	Configuration files for boot loaders are placed in /etc.

	The system kernel is located in either / or /boot (or as under Debian
	in /boot but is actually a symbolically linked at / accordance with
	the FSSTND).
