* A
	AC_INIT(package, version, [bug-report], [tarname], [url])
		Process any command-line arguments and perform various
		  initializations and verifications.
		Set the name of the package and its version. The optional
		  argument bug-report should be the email to which users
		  should send bug reports. The package tarname differs from
		  package: The latter designates the full package name (e.g.,
		  'GNU autoconf'), while the former is meant for distribution
		  tar ball names. (e.g., 'autoconf'). It defaults to package
		  with 'GNU' stripped, lower-cased, and all characters other
		  than alphanumerics and underscores are changed to '-'. If
		  provided, url should be the homepage for the package.
		The arguments of AC_INIT must be static, i.e., there should
		  not be any shell computation, quotes, or newlines, but they
		  can be computed by M4. It is permissible to use m4_easycmd
		  or m4_easycmd_s for computing a version string that changes
		  with every commit to a version control system.
		The following M4 macros (e.g., AC_PACKAGE_NAME), outout
		  variables (e.g., PACKAGE_NAME), and preprocessor symbols (
		  e.g., PACKAGE_NAME), are defined by AC_INIT:
		  AC_PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_NAME
			Exactly package.
		  AC_PACKAGE_TARNAME, PACKAGE_TARNAME
			Exactly tarname, possibly generated from package.
		  AC_PACKAGE_VERSION, PACKAGE_VERSION
			Exactly version.
		  AC_PACKAGE_STRING, PACKAGE_STRING
			Exactly 'package version'
		  AC_PACKAGE_BUGREPORT, PACKAGE_BUGREPORT
			Exactly bug-report, if one was provided. Typically
			an email address, or URL to a bug management web page.
		  AC_PACKAGE_URL, PACKAGE_URL
			Exactly url, if one was provided. If url was empty, but
			package begins with 'GNU', then this defaults to
			'http://www.gnu.org/software/tarname/', otherwise,
			no URL assumed.
	AC_PREREQ(version)
		Ensure that a recent enough version of autoconf is being used.
		This macro may be used be AC_INIT.
	AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION
		Introduced in Autoconf 2.62
		Identifies the version of autoconf that is currently parsing
		  the input file, in a format suitable for m4_version_compare.
		You should not expand this macro directly; use
		  'm4_defn([AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION])' instead.
	AC_COPYRIGHT(copyright-notice)
	AC_REVISION(revision-info)
	AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(unique-file-in-source-dir)
		unique-file-in-source-dir is some file that is in the package's
		  source directory. configure checks for this file's existence
		  to make sure that the directory that it is told contains the
		  source code in fact does.
	AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(dir)
		Use the auxiliary build tools (e.g., install-sh, config-sub,
		  etc.). The default is 'srcdir' or 'srcdir/..' or
		  'srcdir/../..', whichever is the first that contains
		  install-sh.
		The auxiliary directory is commonly named 'build-aux'.
	AC_REQUIRE_AUX_FILE(file)
		Declares that file is expected in the directory defined above.
	AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR(dir)
		Specify dir as the location of additional local autoconf macros
	AC_OUTPUT
		Generates 'config.status' and launch it.
		Call this macro once, at the end of 'configure.ac'.
	AC_PROG_MAKE_SET
		If you use this macro, place a line like this in each
		  'Makefile.in' or 'Makefile.am' that runs MAKE on other
		  directories:
			@SET_MAKE@
	AC_CONFIG_FILES, AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS, AC_CONFIG_LINKS
	AC_CONFIG_ITEMS(tag ..., [commands], [init-cmds])
		tag ...: A blank or newline separated list of tags, which are
		  typically the names of the files to instantiate. tags format
		  can be 'output' or 'output:input'. e.g.:
		  AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile:boiler/top.mk:boiler/bot.mk])
		  The special value '-' might be used to denote the standard
		  output or input depends on which in used.
		  The input may be absolute or relative file names. In the
		  latter case they are first looked in the build tree, and then
		  in the source tree.
		commands: Shell commands output literally into 'config.status',
		  and associated with a tag that the user can use to tell
		  'config.status' which commands to run. The commands are run
		  each time a request is given to 'config.status'. Typically
		  each time the file 'tag' is requested.
		  The variables set during the execution of configure are not
		  available here: you first need to set them via the init-cmds.
		  Nonetheless the following variables are precomputed:
			srcdir
			ac_top_srcdir
			ac_top_build_prefix
			ac_srcdir
			tmp
		init-cmds: Shell commands output unquoted near the beginning
		  of 'config.status', and executed each time 'config.status'
		  runs (regardless of the tag).
