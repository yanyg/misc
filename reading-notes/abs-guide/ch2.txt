2.2 Preliminary Exercises

1. System administrators often write scripts to automate common tasks. Give several instances where such scripts would be useful.
* Answer:
	update-grub
		-- stub for grub-mkconfig
	/etc/init.d/networking
		-- manage netowrks
	/bin/which
		-- locate a command

2. Write a script that upon invocation shows the time and date, lists all logged-in users, and gives the system uptime. The script then saves this information to a logfile.
Copy follows lines between dash-line, then paste it:
-----------------
cat > /tmp/ch2-2.2.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash

{
echo "time and date: $(date --rfc-3339=seconds)"
echo "logged-users: $(users)"
echo "uptime: $(uptime | cut -d, -f1)"
} > /tmp/report-ch2-2.2

echo "cat the file '/tmp/report-ch2-2.2' for details"
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/ch2-2.2.sh
/tmp/ch2-2.2.sh
